Welcome to the **MQTT Bridge of Doom**! This is the place where we try to build a bridge between TagoIO and customer brokers without losing our sanity.

## What is this?

This is a Rust-powered, always-running, MQTT Bridge between TagoIO and customer brokers. 🚀

## Why does it exist?
Imagine this: TagoIO's broker is having heart attacks, and we need to save the day by building a bridge. Sounds heroic, right?

## Current Status
